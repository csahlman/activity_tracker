    <h1>Information About an LLC</h1>

    <p>A limited liability company, commonly called an "LLC," is a business structure that is similar to a corporation, but less formal. Business owners form LLCs to protect themselves from being personally liable for business debts.</p>

    <p>LLCs combine the pass-through taxation of a partnership or sole proprietorship with the limited liability of a corporation. As in a partnership or sole proprietorship, income "passes through" the LLC to the LLC owners, and the owners report the business's income on their personal income tax returns. </p>



    <p>Section 501(c)(3) is the portion of the US Internal Revenue Code that allows for federal tax exemption of nonprofit organizations, specifically those that are considered public charities, private foundations or private operating foundations.
    </p>

    <p>
    Entities that can seek 501(c)(3) determination from the IRS include corporations, trusts, community chests, LLCs[1], and unincorporated associations. The overwhelming majority of 501(c)(3) organizations are nonprofit corporations.
